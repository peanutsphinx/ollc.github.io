                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Our Lady of Lourdes College (OLLC) is a private school in Valenzuela City. It started out in 1986 as
                    the Cherub Learning Center, founded by Mr. and Dr. Alfredo Demetillo. By the following year, the
                    school opened its elementary department.
                    In 1993, the institution began accommodating high school students, and the next year, it began
                    offering programs for college-level students. With its mission of providing educational
                    opportunities to the youth, OLLC has facilities

                    Business Administration, Hospitality
                    Management, Teacher Education, and Information Technology. The basic education department includes a
                    Senior High School (SHS) program providing the Academic and the Technical-Vocational-Livelihood

                    offers various TVET courses, like Bartending, Cookery, and Housekeeping, for those interested in
                    training for certain skills and earning their National Certificate (NC). Our Lady of Lourdes College
